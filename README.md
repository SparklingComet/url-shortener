# url-shortener

When I wrote this software, I was originally testing [Spark, *A micro framework for creating web applications in Kotlin and Java 8 with minimal effort*](http://sparkjava.com).
The result was a very simple link shortening software written on Java. Please notice that this was only created for fun and that I do not attempt to compete with URL-shortening websites such as http://goo.gl,
http://tinyurl.com and http://tiny.cc. I do think, however, that self-hosting open-source software is more secure because you can be sure than nobody is keeping track of your traffic.
